# Role Based Access Control Frontegg

This repository contains a sample implementation of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) using Frontegg, a complete platform for building and operating SaaS applications.

## What is RBAC?

RBAC is a security model that defines permissions based on a user's role in an organization. It helps to limit access to sensitive information and resources, and prevent unauthorized access to them. RBAC provides a more manageable and scalable way to assign permissions to users, as opposed to managing them individually.
